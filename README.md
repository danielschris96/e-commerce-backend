# E-Commerce Back-end
  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description
  This application is a back-end environement for an e-commerce site. We were given the starter code and had to implement models, associations, and routes in order for the application to function. The motivation for this project was to implement newly learned MySQL, Sequelize, and Express.js techniques. There is no front-end to this application so it is only functional within a server environment like Insomnia.
